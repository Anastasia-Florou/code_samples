This is a repository containing two code samples

### Sample 1 - Stair generator

It is part of the EARTHY studio project of TU Delft (MSc Building technology) that focuses on the production of a modular building system with earth for a refuggee camp.
It is written in Python and is based on OOP.

### Sample 2 - Thesis
